# LavaLampEntropy
Inspired by CloudFlares LavaRand (lava lamp entropy wall)

This is a little lava lamp simulator game I made in Python with Pygame and Flask. Java incorperated with my previous knowledge in python and html. 

# Disclaimer: May have some bugs but I will soon fix them.

* What it does: You see colorful blobs floating around like a lava lamp. They move smoothly and bounce off the walls. 
* Extra cool part:  The program turns whatever you see on the screen into a random hash (called entropy). This is like how some security stuff gets random numbers from physical things like Cloudflare’s LavaRand.
* How to play:  Run lavablobs.py and watch the blobs float. Open the web page (localhost/entropy) to see the hash update every couple seconds (refresh page).
* used:
    * Python + Pygame for the blobs and animation
    * Flask for the web server
    * Java client that can fetch the hash
    * HTML/CSS for the web page (in progress)

 
Enjoy! :)
