# LavaLampEntropy
Inspired by CloudFlares LavaRand (lava lamp entropy wall)

This is a little lava lamp simulator game I made in Python with Pygame and Flask. May have some bugs but I will soon fix them.
* What it does: You see colorful blobs floating around like a lava lamp. They move smoothly, bounce off the walls, and glow a bit. 
* Extra cool part: The program turns whatever you see on the screen into a random hash (called entropy). This is like how some security stuff gets random numbers from weird physical things like Cloudflare’s LavaRand.
* How to play: Run lavablobs.py and watch the blobs float. Open the web page to see the hash update every couple seconds.
* Tech used:
    * Python + Pygame for the blobs and animation
    * Flask for the web server
    * Java client that can fetch the hash
    * HTML/CSS for the web page
 
Enjoy :)
